# xiaogz's TADA68 layout

## Build
At root folder, do `make tada68:xiaogz:bin`

## Flashing firmware
With USB connected to keyboard, press the button at the back to disable keyboard and access its storage.
* It's very important to name your firmware file with extension `.bin` and not `.BIN` like what's shown in the keyboard's flash drive!

`mv <your built .bin file> /media/<username>/TADA68`

Press the top-left key on keyboard (default ESC).
